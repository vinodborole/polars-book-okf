# Introducing Polars Cloud

DataFrame implementations always differed from SQL and databases. SQL could run anywhere from embedded databases to massive data warehouses. Yet, DataFrame users have been forced to choose between a solution for local work or solutions geared towards distributed computing, each with their own APIs and limitations.

Polars is bridging this gap with **Polars Cloud**. Build on top of the popular open source project,
Polars Cloud enables you to write DataFrame code once and run it anywhere. The distributed engine
available with Polars Cloud lets you scale your Polars queries beyond a single machine.

## Key Features of Polars Cloud

- **Unified DataFrame Experience**: Run a Polars query seamlessly on your local machine and at scale with our new distributed engine. All from the same API.
- **Serverless Compute**: Effortlessly start compute resources without managing infrastructure with options to execute queries on both CPU and GPU (coming soon).
- **Any Environment**: Start a remote query from a notebook on your machine, Airflow DAG, AWS Lambda, or your server. Get the flexibility to embed Polars Cloud in any environment.

## Install Polars Cloud

Simply extend the capabilities of Polars with:

```
pip install polars polars_cloud
```
## Example query

To run your query in the cloud, simply write Polars queries like you are used to, but call
`LazyFrame.remote()` to indicate that the query should be run remotely.

  `ComputeContext` ·  `LazyFrameRemote`

```
import polars as pl
import polars_cloud as pc
ctx = pc.ComputeContext(workspace="your-workspace", cpus=16, memory=64)
query = (
    pl.scan_parquet("s3://my-dataset/")
    .group_by("l_returnflag", "l_linestatus")
    .agg(
        avg_price=pl.mean("l_extendedprice"),
        avg_disc=pl.mean("l_discount"),
        count_order=pl.len(),
    )
)
query.remote(context=ctx).sink_parquet("s3://my-dst/")
```
