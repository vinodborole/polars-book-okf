# Blazingly Fast DataFrame Library

Polars is a blazingly fast DataFrame library for manipulating structured data. The core is written in Rust, and available for Python, R and NodeJS.

## Key features

- **Fast** : Written from scratch in Rust, designed close to the machine and without external
  dependencies.
- **I/O** : First class support for all common data storage layers: local, cloud storage & databases.
- **Intuitive API** : Write your queries the way they were intended. Polars, internally, will
  determine the most efficient way to execute using its query optimizer.
- **Out of Core** : The streaming API allows you to process your results without requiring all your
  data to be in memory at the same time.
- **Parallel** : Utilises the power of your machine by dividing the workload among the available CPU
  cores without any additional configuration.
- **Vectorized Query Engine**
- **GPU Support** : Optionally run queries on NVIDIA GPUs for maximum performance for in-memory or
  streaming workloads.
- **[Apache Arrow support](https://arrow.apache.org/)** : Polars can consume and produce Arrow data
  often with zero-copy operations. Note that Polars is not built on a Pyarrow/Arrow implementation.
  Instead, Polars has its own compute and buffer implementations.

Users new to DataFrames

A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that is useful for data manipulation and analysis. With labeled axes for rows and columns, each column can contain different data types, making complex data operations such as merging and aggregation much easier. Due to their flexibility and intuitive way of storing and working with data, DataFrames have become increasingly popular in modern data analytics and engineering.

## Philosophy

The goal of Polars is to provide a lightning fast DataFrame library that:

- Utilizes all available cores on your machine.
- Optimizes queries to reduce unneeded work/memory allocations.
- Handles datasets much larger than your available RAM.
- A consistent and predictable API.
- Adheres to a strict schema (data-types should be known before running the query).

Polars is written in Rust which gives it C/C++ performance and allows it to fully control performance-critical parts in a query engine.

## Example

  [`scan_csv`](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.scan_csv.html) ·  [`filter`](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/dataframe/api/polars.DataFrame.filter.html) ·  [`group_by`](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/dataframe/api/polars.DataFrame.group_by.html) ·  [`collect`](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/lazyframe/api/polars.LazyFrame.collect.html)

```
import polars as pl
q = (
    pl.scan_csv("docs/assets/data/iris.csv")
    .filter(pl.col("sepal_length") > 5)
    .group_by("species")
    .agg(pl.all().sum())
)
df = q.collect()
```
  [`LazyCsvReader`](https://docs.pola.rs/api/rust/dev/polars/prelude/struct.LazyCsvReader.html) ·  [`filter`](https://docs.pola.rs/api/rust/dev/polars_lazy/frame/struct.LazyFrame.html#method.filter) ·  [`group_by`](https://docs.pola.rs/api/rust/dev/polars_lazy/frame/struct.LazyFrame.html#method.group_by) ·  [`collect`](https://docs.pola.rs/api/rust/dev/polars/prelude/struct.LazyFrame.html#method.collect) ·  [Available on feature csv](/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) ·  [Available on feature streaming](/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags)

```
use polars::prelude::*;
let q = LazyCsvReader::new(PlRefPath::new("docs/assets/data/iris.csv"))
    .with_has_header(true)
    .finish()?
    .filter(col("sepal_length").gt(lit(5)))
    .group_by(vec![col("species")])
    .agg([col("*").sum()]);
let df = q.collect()?;
```
